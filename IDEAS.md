# What are we looking for?
Here is a collection of topics and ideas you can work on in the developer competition …

#### Business Solutions and Go-to-Market Offerings
Collaborate on prototyping a vertical business solution, e.g. something similar to [PSD/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Services_Directive) and the [Open Bank Project](https://github.com/OpenBankProject). Or, develop a go-to-market offering with the goal to containerize a customer’s application landscape and streamline their application lifecycle.

#### Solutions that support a community or a social cause
Think of solutions that support Civic Technology, Open Data, Data Journalism or Open Government Initiatives. Or bring existing open source solutions in this space into the world of containers.

#### New Workloads
Use the OpenShift Container Platform to run innovative workloads like predictive analytics or machine learning. Or the good old batch processing and number crunching jobs.

#### Integrate the Container Platform
Build an integration with e.g. Slack to receive notifications from OpenShift or to trigger a deployment (“SlackOps”). Or develope an OpenShift Skill for the Amazon Echo ...

#### (Hybrid-) Cloud Management
The OpenShift Container Platform allows to scale workloads, but who scales the container platform? Use monitoring and automation tools to automatically scale the cluster up and down. And what about cluster backup-and-recovery?
