# How do I sign-up?

The sign-up process involves four steps:

1. Join Slack
2. Create a project proposal
3. Form a team
4. Register the team and project

## Join the Slack workspace

1. Join the Slack Workspace: [https://redhat-capgemini.slack.com/signup](https://redhat-capgemini.slack.com/signup)
2. Join the `#10_dev_competition` channel.

Our shared Capgemini & Red Hat Slack workspace is used to communicate all important updates related to the developer competition. 
We also encourage everyone to use it to:

* Ask questions related to the developer competition
* Collaborate with your team
* Get updates on Red Hat products and technologies

#### Note:
You MUST use your work email address to sign-up. Only addresses ending in `@capgemini.com` or `@sogeti.com` are accepted.

## Create a project proposal

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/redhatgsiexchange/dev_competition/issues) to register project proposals and to collaborate on the refinement of the project specification. The issue MUST explain what your project is about, why it is relevant 
for customers, what technology will be used, etc. Other participants can then comment or offer their help.

To start, create a [new issue](https://github.com/redhatgsiexchange/dev_competition/issues/new?template=project-proposal.md) for your project and provide the following information:

```
### Short description
=> Describe your project in 1 or 2 sentences.

### Description
=> Long and detailed description of the project.
```

### Labels

We use labels to indicate the state of a project proposal. The following labels are available:

* `accepted` - This project proposal has been accepted
* `declined` - This project proposal has been declined
* `clarification` - The project proposal needs clarification
* `duplicate` - A similar project proposal already exists
* `comment wanted` - Please comment on this project proposal
* `help wanted` - Additional team members are needed
* `ready` - The project proposal is ready to be reviewed

## Form a team

There is no formal process how to recruit team members. Reach out to collegues or ask for help in the Slack channel. Once you have your team assembled, update the `Team` section of your project proposal page with the GitHub use names of your team members.

## Register the team and project

If the project proposal is ready for a review, add the `ready` label to it. We will then review the proposal and ask for additional 
information and clarification if needed. Once everything is fine, we will add the 'accepted` label and create a dedicated project description page. The issue will then be closed.

### Changes to the project description after it has been accepted

1. Fork the repository
2. Make changes to the project description page
3. Submit a pull request
