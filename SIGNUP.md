# How do I sign-up?

The sign-up process involves four steps:

1. Join Slack
2. Create a project proposal
3. Form a team
4. Register the team and project

## Join the Slack workspace

Our shared Capgemini & Red Hat Slack workspace is used to communicate all important updates related to the developer competition. 
We also encourage everyone to use it to
* Ask questions related to the developer competition
* Collaborate with your team
* Get updates on Red Hat products and technologies

1. Join the Slack Workspace: [https://redhat-capgemini.slack.com/signup](https://redhat-capgemini.slack.com/signup)

2. Join the `#10_dev_competition` channel.

#### Note:
You have to use your work email address to sign-up. Only addresses ending in `@capgemini.com` or `@sogeti.com` are accepted.

## Create a project proposal

In order to describe your project and to refine the proposal, we use use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/redhatgsiexchange/dev_competition/issues). This allows you to explain what your project is about, why it is relevant 
for customers, what technology will be used, etc. Other participants can comment on your project or offer their help.

To start, create a [new issue](https://github.com/redhatgsiexchange/dev_competition/issues/new?template=project-proposal.md) for your project and provide the following information:

```
### Short description
=> Describe your project in 1 or 2 sentences.

### Description
=> Long and detailed description of the project.
```

## Form a team
