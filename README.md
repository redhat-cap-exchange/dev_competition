# The Capgemini Developer Competition

## TL;DR

Are you the geek who lives and breathes technology? Do you feel the joy of creation when developing a piece of code or a solution? If the answer is yes, then this Red Hat competition is for you!

It has been specially created for Capgemini and designed with the objective of accelerated learning and building reusable solutions. And the participating teams will win bags of kudos for being the best in the business for cloud-native apps!

So if we have stirred your curiosity, please read on.

## What is it?

Build business- or technical solutions that leverage the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the Red Hat Middleware Portfolio or our Management & Automation tools to demonstrate Capgemini’s capability to deliver modern, cloud-native solutions.

### Objectives

* Create solutions that address customer requirements
* Allow developers to be involved in state of the art technologies
* Build awareness for the Red Hat portfolio across Capgemini

## How will it work?

1. Form a team of two to five like-minded colleagues to develop the solution.

2. Define the project. The team should collaborate on a topic that everyone is passionate about. The scope of the project should be defined early on with a focus on the 'WHY?'. Why is this project important to work on? How does it help your customers?

3. Collaborate and work in [THE OPEN SOURCE WAY](https://opensource.com/open-source-way). Ideally the project can be completed in a couple of days. Collaboration can happen in person or remotely, the open source way.

## How can I sign-up?

In order to participate, you have to sign-up to our Slack workspace and get an account on GitHub if you do not have one yet.

## What are we looking for?
Here is a collection of ideas to be worked on during the developer competition …

**Business Solutions and Go-to-Market Offerings**
Collaborate on prototyping a vertical business solution, e.g. related to PSD/2. Or, develop a go-to-market program with the goal to containerize a customer’s application landscape and streamline their application lifecycle.

**Solutions that support a community or a social cause**
Think of solutions that support Civic Technology, Open Data, Data Journalism or Open Government Initiatives. Or bring existing open source solutions in this space into the world of containers.

**New Workloads**
Use the OpenShift Container Platform to run innovative workloads like predictive analytics or machine learning. Or the good old batch processing, number crunching jobs.

**Integrate the Container Platform**
Build an integration with e.g. Slack to receive notifications from OCP or to trigger a deployment (“SlackOps”). Or develope an OpenShift Skill for the Amazon Echo ...

**(Hybrid-) Cloud Management**
The OpenShift Container Platform allows to scale workloads, but who scales the container platform? Use monitoring and automation tools to automatically scale the cluster up and down. And what about cluster backup-and-recovery?
