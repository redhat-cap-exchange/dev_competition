# The Capgemini Developer Competition

Are you the geek who lives and breathes technology? Do you feel the joy of creation when developing a piece of code or a solution? If the answer is yes, then this Red Hat Developer Competition is for you!

It has been specially created for Capgemini and designed with the objective of accelerated learning and building reusable solutions. And the participating teams will win bags of kudos for being the best in the business for cloud-native apps!

So if we have stirred your curiosity, please read on.

## What is the competition about?

Build business- or technical solutions that leverage the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the Red Hat Middleware Portfolio or our Management & Automation tools to demonstrate Capgeminiâ€™s capability to deliver modern, cloud-native solutions.

### Objectives

* Create solutions that address customer requirements
* Allow developers to be involved in state of the art technologies
* Build awareness for the Red Hat portfolio across Capgemini

The [ideas page](https://github.com/redhatgsiexchange/dev_competition/blob/master/IDEAS.md) gives you an overview of suggest topics to work on.

#### How does it work?

1. Form a team of two to five like-minded colleagues to develop the solution.

2. Define the project. The team should collaborate on a topic that everyone is passionate about. The scope of the project should be defined early on with a focus on the 'WHY?'. Why is this project important to work on? How does it help your customers?

3. Collaborate and work in [THE OPEN SOURCE WAY](https://opensource.com/open-source-way). Ideally the project can be completed in a couple of days. Collaboration can happen in person or remotely, the open source way.
